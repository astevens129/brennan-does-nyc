    <section class="about-box" aria-labelledby="site-purpose">
      <p class="center-text"><em>This site is a love letter.</em></p>

      <p id="site-purpose">
        A love letter to both New York Cityâ€”its chaos, its poetry, its subway prophets and sidewalk saintsâ€”and to Brennan Lee Mulliganâ€”Dungeon Master, comedian, storyteller, bird enthusiast, and profoundly decent human beingâ€”who has spent years weaving the cityâ€™s spirit into every tale he tells.
      </p>

      <p>
        Across campaigns, interviews, podcasts, and passing quips about municipal juggling, Brennan has become a bard of the boroughsâ€”a mythmaker who understands that NYC is more than a skyline. Itâ€™s a character, a crucible, a spell in progress. A place where every bodega sandwich is a side quest, every subway line a leyline, and every pigeon might be a wizard, a ghost, or just an asshole with wings.
      </p>

      <p>
        This guide was born out of both love and logistics.<br />
        We wanted to gather every Brennanism, every quote and hidden gem, into one placeâ€”to make it easier to see New York through his eyes: with reverence, humor, and bone-deep affection.
      </p>

      <p>
        Part of what makes Brennanâ€™s stories feel so truthful is that he doesnâ€™t just craft villains with swords and horns. He conjures antagonists made of systems, scarcity, and unchecked power. Whether itâ€™s a shadowy developer evicting magical tenants or a highway hex draining a cityâ€™s soul, Brennan has a way of turning capitalism itself into the final bossâ€”somehow without ever losing sight of the humanity trapped inside it. He reminds us that resistance can be mythic, that empathy is radical, and that fighting for community is the most heroic quest of all.<br />
        That feeling is the very soul of NYC.
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        <p>This city is both brutal and beautiful. It's full of humor. It is simultaneously haunted and holy.  
        It has a way of forcing you to confront your shared humanity in ways you didnâ€™t even know you were avoiding.</p>
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        If youâ€™ve ever cried in a deli at 2 a.m., felt safe among strangers, or caught a glimpse of something divine between train delays, then this city already knows your name. Brennan just gave you the map.
      </p>

        So, whether youâ€™re planning a trip, chasing down lore, or you simply love Brennan Lee Mulligan, Dropout.TV, Dimension 20, Worlds Beyond Number, Make Some Noise, Gamechanger, or any of his associated works as much as we do:
        <br>  
        <strong><em>Welcome. You belong here.</em></strong>
